								>>>Employee Management System<<<

Dear Sir/Madam......

***Type of Access***
	
1. Admin Access
2. Employee Access

For Admin access you have to enter 99 and Password is Password.

For any other number is available in the file you can access Employee File.By Default we have 2 employee Detail so you can enter any one. After adding another Data you can access this particular ID no.

***Modify Module***

Solution 1 : 

Modify Module is working correctly but if you modify only one data then its not working. If you modify 2 data then only first data are changed but second data are as it is. If you modify 3 data then first 2 data are modified but last is not modify. So last Data are not modified every time.

Solution 2 :

Another Solution is after Modify 1 Data ask Do you want to Modify another record then press yes and then enter non-existing Employee No. So All Data are Modified
